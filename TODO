This is a list of known shortcomings and missing features. As always, patches
are welcome, but please get in touch before embarking on anything major to
discuss the implementation.


TODO
----

* Add homebrew cask support

* Add a commandline option for specifying local dep paths.
  https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka/issues/197
  https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka/issues/251

* Investigate whether adding an apt source on setup is really required on debian systems.
  https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka/issues/339

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

* Parameter changes don't cause templates to be re-rendered, because they don't form part of the hash.
  https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka/issues/246

* Parameters handle booleans poorly, necessitating `param == "true"` and so on.
  https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka/issues/288

* Filenames of downloaded paths are inconsistent because they're taken from URLs that might be the result of a redirect.
